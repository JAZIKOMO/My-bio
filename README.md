# My-bio
My professional biography
I am a media professional with over 4 years of experience in buying, selling, and auditing advertising campaigns and space.
I thrive in ambiguous, high pressure environments where delivering commercial outcomes is the name of the game.
In the future I will have a much more robust personal statement and linkedin presence. I will have a number of relevant data skills and will be able to deliver out on a range of projects with this skillset.
